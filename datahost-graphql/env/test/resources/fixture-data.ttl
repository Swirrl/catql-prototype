emissions going back to 1990. Estimates are presented by source in February of
each year. They are updated in March of each year to include estimates by end-
user, and in June to include estimates by Standard Industrial Classification
(SIC).

These statistics covers emissions that occur within the UK’s borders. When
emissions are reported by source, emissions are attributed to the sector that
emits them directly. When emissions are reported by end-user, energy supply
emissions by source are reallocated in accordance with where the end-use
activity occurred. This reallocation of emissions is based on a modelling
process. For example, all the carbon dioxide produced by a power station is
allocated to the power station when reporting on a source basis. However, when
applying the end-user method, these emissions are reallocated to the users of
this electricity, such as domestic homes or large industrial users.

BEIS does not estimate emissions outside the UK associated with UK
consumption, however the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
publishes estimates of the [UK’s carbon
footprint](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/uks-carbon-footprint)
annually.

For the purposes of reporting, greenhouse gas emissions are allocated into a
small number of broad, high level sectors known as National Communication
sectors, which are as follows: energy supply, business, transport, public,
residential, agriculture, industrial processes, land use land use change and
forestry (LULUCF), and waste management.

These high-level sectors are made up of a number of more detailed sectors,
which follow the definitions set out by the [International Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC)](http://www.ipcc.ch/), and which are used in international
reporting tables which are submitted to the [United Nations Framework

Any changes between years may reflect changes in the absolute value of the £ (affected by the domestic rate of inflation and by exchange rates), as well as changes in actual trade volume. These statistics are further broken down by selected countries, regions and continents.The latest year for which these estimates are available is 2018. Estimates of trade in services have been constructed from ONS official statistics using international classifications (StandardIndustrial Classification (SIC) codes). For further information see Annex A and the quality assurance (QA) document accompanying this report.Data are available for each DCMS Sector (excluding Tourism and Civil Society) and sub-sectors within the Creative Industries, Digital Sector, and Cultural Sector. There is significant overlap between DCMS Sectors so users should be aware that the estimate for “DCMSSectors Total” is lower than the sum of the individual sectors.

The World totals are calculated on the same basis as previous years. However, the list of individual countries used in the calculation of the (world) regional and continental statistics (e.g. European Union, Latin America and Caribbean, Asia) is slightly different to the previous (August 2019) release. Therefore, these statistics in particular are not directly comparable with previous years. In particular:
-The Bailiwick of Guernsey, the Bailiwick of Jersey and Timor-Leste form part of the Europe, Rest of Europe and    Asia totals for the first time.
-Gibraltar is included, and now forms part of the European Union total, in line with the Balance of Payments Vademecum. The EU Institutions total is also included on its own for the first time.
-Latin America & Caribbean no longer includes America Unallocated as part of its calculation.
A revised backseries of calculations on the current basis is expected to be provided in the summer.

New statistics presented in this article have been achieved as part of our ambitious trade development plan to provide more detail than ever before about the UK’s trading relationships, using improved data sources and methods enabled by our new trade IT systems.

When thinking about trade, most people imagine lorries passing through ports. While this is true for trade in goods, this is not the case for trade in services, which are not physical. Trade in services statistics are by nature more challenging to measure, due largely to their intangible nature. While it is relatively straightforward to measure the number of cars that are imported and exported through UK ports, capturing the amount UK advertisers generate from providing services to overseas clients is much more challenging. Nevertheless, it is important that we continue to develop our trade in services statistics given the UK is an overwhelmingly services dominated economy.

While our trade in services statistics already record the type of products being traded (for example, financial services) and who it is being traded with (for example, Germany), policymakers are increasingly interested in how that trade is conducted. This type of information is critical for understanding what barriers businesses face when looking to trade, and to assist policymakers engaged in trade negotiations.

To increase the information available to users on how UK trade in services is conducted, we have been developing statistics on so-called “modes of supply”. The UK is one of the first countries to have developed such estimates.

The estimates shown in this workbook are experimental. While we have made some important changes (please refer to the article),
the basic concepts and methodology underpinning this analysis is still largely similar to the methods used in our original article
\"Estimating the value of service exports abroad from different parts of the UK: 2011 to 2014\" published on 8 July 2016 at:

**Footnotes:**

Smaller geographic breakdowns may not sum exactly to aggregated totals due to rounding.

The European Union consists of 28 member countries including the United Kingdom. For trade purposes, this includes all 27 countries other than the UK as well as the European Central Bank and European Institutions.

The industrial groups presented in this analysis are based on the UK Standard Industrial Classification 2007, although some changes have been made. Primary and utilities represents SIC07 section A, B, D and E; Non-manufacturing production services represents SIC07 section A, B, D, E and F; section G has been split into two parts (Wholesale and motor trades, and Retail); Other services comprises of O, P, Q, R, S and unknown/unallocated industries.

The broader industry groups consist of production industries (SIC07 A-E), and two groups of services: business-based professional services (SIC07 L-N) and all other services (SIC07 G-K and O-S).

For further information about the industrial classification, please see: [UK SIC 2007](https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/classificationsandstandards/ukstandardindustrialclassificationofeconomicactivities/uksic2007).

Experimental dataset providing a breakdown of UK trade in services by industry, country and service type on a balance of payments basis. Data are subject to disclosure control, which means some data have been suppressed to protect confidentiality of individual traders.

Users should note the following:
Industry data has been produced using Standard Industrial Classification 2007 (SIC07).

Service type data has been produced using Extended Balance of Payments (EBOPs).
Due to risks around disclosing data releated to individual firms we are only able to provide data for certain combinations of the dimensions included, i.e. country, service type and industry. This dataset therefore provides the following two combinations:
Industry (SIC07 2 digit), by service type (EBOPs 1 digit), by geographic region (world total, EU and non-EU)
Industry (SIC07 2 digit), by total service type, by individual country
Some data cells have been suppressed to protect confidentiality so that individual traders cannot be identified.

Data
All data is in £ million, current prices

Rounding
Some of the totals within this release (e.g. EU, Non EU and world total) may not exactly match data published via other trade releases due to small rounding differences.

Trade Asymmetries
These data are our best estimate of these bilateral UK trade flows. Users should note that alternative estimates are available, in some cases, via the statistical agencies for bilateral countries or through central databases such as UN Comtrade (https://comtrade.un.org/)

  dcterms:description """Quarterly estimates of total trade, trade in goods and trade in services by country, non-seasonally adjusted.
These tables have been produced to provide an aggregated quarterly goods and services estimate and combines the most recent estimates for goods and services split by country.
Data for goods and services is consistent for annual whole world totals and quarters (from Q1 2016) with the trade data published in the Quarterly National Accounts, Quarterly Sector Accounts and Quarterly Balance of Payments on 30th September 2020.
These data are our best estimate of these bilateral UK trade flows. Users should note that alternative estimates are available, in some cases, via the statistical agencies for bilateral countries or through central databases such as:
UN Comtrade.
Some data for countries have been marked with N/A. This is because Trade in Goods do not collate data from these countries, therefore only Trade in Services is reflected within total trade for these countries
The data within these tables are also consistent with the below releases:
For Trade in Goods the data is consistent with UK Trade: August 2020 publication on 9th October 2020
For Trade in Services the data is consistent with UK Trade in services by partner country: April to June 2020 publication on 4th November 2020

Experimental dataset providing a breakdown of UK trade in goods by industry, country and commodity on a balance of payments basis. Data are subject to disclosure control, which means some data have been suppressed to protect confidentiality of individual traders.

Users should note the following:
Industry data has been produced using Standard Industrial Classification 2007 (SIC07).

Commodity data has been produced using Standard International Trade Classification (SITC).

Due to risks around disclosing data related to individual firms we are only able to provide data for certain combinations of the dimensions included, i.e. country, commodity and industry. This dataset therefore provides the following two combinations:
    Industry (SIC07 2 digit), by Commodity (SITC 2 digit), by geographic region (worldwide, EU and non-EU)
    Industry (SIC07 2 digit), by Commodity total, by individual country

Some data has been suppressed to protect confidentiality so that individual traders cannot be identified.

Methodology improvements
Within this latest experimental release improvements have been made to the methodology that has resulted in some revisions when compared to our previous release in April 2019.
These changes include; improvements to the data linking methodology and a targeted allocation of some of the Balance of Payments (BoP) adjustments to industry.
The data linking improvements were required due to subtleties in both the HMRC data and IDBR not previously recognised within Trade.

While we are happy with the quality of the data in this experimental release we have noticed some data movements, specifically in 2018.
We will continue to review the movements seen in both the HMRC microdata and the linking methodology and, where appropriate, will further develop the methodology for Trade in Goods by Industry for future releases.

Data
All data is in £ million, current prices.

Rounding
Some of the totals within this release (e.g. EU, Non EU and worldwide) may not exactly match data published via other trade releases due to small rounding differences.

Trade Asymmetries
These data are our best estimate of these bilateral UK trade flows. Users should note that alternative estimates are available, in some cases, via the statistical agencies for bilateral countries or through central databases such as UN Comtrade.

Data source

This is additional analysis using the HMRC Regional Trade in Goods Statistics.

How to interpret the data

Business Count: This data shows the number of businesses importing or exporting goods. This is broken down by their UK region and partner countries.
Regional comparisons: This data shows import or export data within a particular quarter or year for UK regions alongside the same data for the UK. This is based on three metrics; the number of importing or exporting businesses , the value of trade, and the average value per business.

Businesses can appear in more than one quarter and can trade with more than one destination. Therefore users should not add up across quarters or partner countries.

1. Methodology for allocating businesses to UK regions

As a result of the HMRC RTS methodology consultation the way businesses are allocated to UK region and country has changed. The previous methodology allocated trade to a region based on where the headquarters of a business is located, supplemented by survey data to allow better allocation of multi-site businesses.
This survey data is out of date and HMRC decided to develop a new methodology.
In the current methodology the trade value of a multi-site business is allocated to different regions based on a proportion of their employees in each region (based on linked information from the Inter Departmental Business Register).
Data on the number of traders is shown in two different way in the RTS release tables:
Whole Number Method (does not add up to UK total): A business will be counted as one in every region they have employees. This represents the actual count of businesses in any region. However, it will mean the sum of the business count for each region will be greater than that for the UK.

Proportion Method (adds up to UK total): A business will be counted as a fraction in each region they trade based on the proportion of their employees in each region. An individual business counts as one business in the UK. The sum of businesses (whole and fractions) gives the total business count for a region.
The data in this analysis uses both methods. Please refer to the correct output for each methodology and flow.

2. The number of businesses importing or exporting

Business counts are a count of all VAT Registered businesses exporting and importing.
Aside from the EU/non-EU split (published as part of the RTS) there is no disaggregation of businesses not required to submit full EU declarations (below threshold traders) by EU partner country. The supplementary analysis provided here does split the number of businesses by EU partner country but these do not include the below threshold traders.

Exclusions
This dataset excludes businesses that cannot be allocated to a region due to lack of information about the business (unallocated - unknown). It does include businesses where details are known, but cannot be allocated due to the type of business (unallocated - known).  Further information can be found in the

RTS Methodology paper.

This analysis also excludes 'unallocated - unknown' in the UK value totals, in order to make ratios (exports per exporter) and comparisons valid. Where information is known about a business but it is not possible to allocate to a specific region it is classed as 'unallocated - known'. These 'unallocated - known' businesses are included in both the value and count for UK totals.
RTS data excludes trade in non-monetary gold, whereas HMRC OTS data does include this from 2005 onwards. RTS data also excludes non-response estimates. Therefore, it matches the 'total reported trade' figures in the OTS with the exception of non-monetary gold. More information can be found in section 3.20 of the RTS Methodology Paper.

Suppressions
A very small number of cells in the Business Counts tab have been suppressed under our statistical disclosure policy. These are shown a ‘S’ under the business count. Due to a review of disclosure, some data previously suppressed under the output produce by Department for International Trade (Exports proportion method only) may now be shown.
Further information on trade in goods by UK region
HMRC publish quarterly data on trade by UK region in Regional Trade in Goods Statistics. This includes information on the number of exporters to the EU and Non-EU.

Detail on trade value by UK region, trade partner and commodity is available in Build Your Own Tables:
https://www.uktradeinfo.com/Statistics/BuildYourOwnTables/Pages/Home.aspx

2020 data is provisional and subject to update.

Monthly import country-by-commodity data on the UK's trade in goods, including trade by all countries and selected commodities, non-seasonally adjusted.

Users should note the following:
Industry data has been produced using Standard Industrial Classification 2007 (SIC07).
Commodity data has been produced using Standard International Trade Classification (SITC).

Due to risks around disclosing data related to individual firms we are only able to provide data for certain combinations of the dimensions included, i.e. country, commodity and industry. This dataset therefore provides the following two combinations:
    Industry (SIC07 2 digit), by Commodity (SITC 2 digit), by geographic region (worldwide, EU and non-EU)
    Industry (SIC07 2 digit), by Commodity total, by individual country

Methodology improvements
Within this latest experimental release improvements have been made to the methodology that has resulted in some revisions when compared to our previous release in April 2019.
These changes include; improvements to the data linking methodology and a targeted allocation of some of the Balance of Payments (BoP) adjustments to industry.
The data linking improvements were required due to subtleties in both the HMRC data and IDBR not previously recognised within Trade.

While we are happy with the quality of the data in this experimental release we have noticed some data movements, specifically in 2018.
We will continue to review the movements seen in both the HMRC microdata and the linking methodology and, where appropriate, will further develop the methodology for Trade in Goods by Industry for future releases.

Trade in goods data, including breakdown of imports and exports by Standard Industrial Classification, region (EU and non-EU), business size and by domestic and foreign ownership.

Users should note the following:
Industry data has been produced using Standard Industrial Classification 2007 (SIC07).

Business size is defined using the following employment size bands:
   Small - 0-49 employees
   Medium - 50-249 employees
   Large - 250+ employees
   Unknown - number of employees cannot be determined via IDBR

Ownership status is defined as:
   Domestic - ultimate controlling parent company located in the UK
   Foreign - ultimate controlling parent company located outside the UK
   Unknown - location of ultimate controlling parent company cannot be determined via IDBR

Some data cells have been suppressed to protect confidentiality so that individual traders cannot be identified.

Data
All data is in £ million, current prices

Rounding
Some of the totals within this release (e.g. EU, Non EU and world total) may not exactly match data published via other trade releases due to small rounding differences.

Trade Asymmetries
These data are our best estimate of these bilateral UK trade flows. Users should note that alternative estimates are available, in some cases, via the statistical agencies for bilateral countries or through central databases such as UN Comtrade

  pmdcat:markdownDescription """This publication provides the final estimates of UK territorial greenhouse gas
emissions going back to 1990.

Estimates are presented by source in February of each year. They are updated
each year:

  * in March, to include estimates by end-user and fuel type
  * in June, to include estimates by Standard Industrial Classification (SIC)

The statistics covers emissions that occur within the UK’s borders. When
emissions are reported by source, emissions are attributed to the sector that
emits them directly. When emissions are reported by end-user, energy supply
emissions by source are reallocated in accordance with where the end-use
activity occurred. This reallocation of emissions is based on a modelling
process. For example, all the carbon dioxide produced by a power station is
allocated to the power station when reporting on a source basis. However, when
applying the end-user method, these emissions are reallocated to the users of
this electricity, such as domestic homes or large industrial users.

BEIS does not estimate emissions outside the UK associated with UK
consumption, however the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
publishes estimates of the [UK’s carbon
footprint](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/uks-carbon-footprint)
annually. The [alternative approaches to reporting UK greenhouse gas emissions
report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-greenhouse-gas-
emissions-explanatory-notes) outlines the differences between them.

For the purposes of reporting, greenhouse gas emissions are allocated into a
small number of broad, high level sectors known as National Communication
sectors, which are as follows: energy supply, business, transport, public,
residential, agriculture, industrial processes, land use land use change and
forestry (LULUCF), and waste management.

These high-level sectors are made up of a number of more detailed sectors,
which follow the definitions set out by the [International Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC)](http://www.ipcc.ch/), and which are used in international
reporting tables which are submitted to the [United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)](https://unfccc.int/) every year. A
[list of corresponding Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) used and a record of
base year emissions](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-greenhouse-
gas-emissions-explanatory-notes) are published separately.

This is a National Statistics publication and complies with the Code of
Practice for Statistics.

International trade in goods data at summary product and country level, by UK regions and devolved administrations.


HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) collects the UK's international trade in goods data, which are published as two National Statistics series - the 'Overseas Trade in Goods Statistics (OTS)' and the 'Regional Trade in Goods Statistics (RTS)'. The RTS are published quarterly showing trade at summary product and country level, split by UK regions and devolved administrations.

RTS data is categorised by partner country and Standard International Trade Classification, Rev.4 (SITC) at division level (2-digit). In this release RTS data is analysed mainly at partner country and SITC section (1-digit) level, with references to specific SITC divisions where appropriate.

International trade in goods data at summary product and country level, by UK regions and devolved administrations.


HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) collects the UK's international trade in goods data, which are published as two National Statistics series - the 'Overseas Trade in Goods Statistics (OTS)' and the 'Regional Trade in Goods Statistics (RTS)'. The RTS are published quarterly showing trade at summary product and country level, split by UK regions and devolved administrations.

RTS data is categorised by partner country and Standard International Trade Classification, Rev.4 (SITC) at division level (2-digit). In this release RTS data is analysed mainly at partner country and SITC section (1-digit) level, with references to specific SITC divisions where appropriate. The collection and publication methodology for the RTS is available on www.gov.uk.

  pmdcat:markdownDescription """These statistics provide the most reliable and consistent breakdown of CO2
emissions across the country, using nationally available data sets going back
to 2005.

The main data sources are the UK National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory and
the BEIS National Statistics of energy consumption for local authority areas.
All emissions included in the national inventory are covered, except aviation,
shipping and military transport, for which there is no obvious basis for
allocation to local areas.

Publications:

  * statistical summary: one page summary of local authority emissions statistics
  * statistical release: summary of local authority emissions statistics including UK emissions maps
  * data tables: all data tables for local authority emissions
  * technical report: methodology adopted to estimate carbon dioxide emissions at local level
  * employment based energy consumption mapping in the UK: methodology used to map emissions from smaller industrial and commercial sources
  * mapping carbon emissions and removals for the land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector: LULUCF emissions and removals at the local authority level, prepared by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH)
  * dataset of local authority emissions data (revised 5 August 2021: updated to fix formatting error where totals were split over multiple rows: actual figures remain the same)

In addition, [interactive local authority level emissions
maps](http://naei.defra.gov.uk/data/local-authority-co2-map) are published on
the National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (NAEI) website on behalf of BEIS.
Users can zoom in to any UK local authority, see the emissions for the area
and identify the significant point sources, such as iron and steel plants. The
data can be filtered by sector, and to see how emissions have changed across
the time series.

[Air pollution data](https://naei.beis.gov.uk/reports/reports?report_id=999)
are also available on a local authority basis which looks at a number of gases
that cause air pollution. Carbon dioxide which is presented in the emissions
reports above is also considered an air pollutant. A number of activities
contribute to both air pollutant and carbon dioxide emissions. Other
activities that contribute to carbon dioxide emissions do not contribute to
air pollutant emissions and vice versa.

Moreover, there are a number of entirely human-made GHGs in the atmosphere, such as the halocarbons and other chlorine- and bromine-containing substances, dealt with under the Montreal Protocol. Beside CO2, N2O and CH4, the Kyoto Protocol deals with the GHGs sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs).

  pmdcat:markdownDescription """This publication provides the final estimates of UK territorial greenhouse gas
emissions going back to 1990.

Estimates are presented by source in February of each year. They are updated
each year:

  * in March, to include estimates by end-user and fuel type
  * in June, to include estimates by Standard Industrial Classification (SIC)

The statistics covers emissions that occur within the UK’s borders. When
emissions are reported by source, emissions are attributed to the sector that
emits them directly. When emissions are reported by end-user, energy supply
emissions by source are reallocated in accordance with where the end-use
activity occurred. This reallocation of emissions is based on a modelling
process. For example, all the carbon dioxide produced by a power station is
allocated to the power station when reporting on a source basis. However, when
applying the end-user method, these emissions are reallocated to the users of
this electricity, such as domestic homes or large industrial users.

BEIS does not estimate emissions outside the UK associated with UK
consumption, however the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
publishes estimates of the [UK’s carbon
footprint](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/uks-carbon-footprint)
annually. The [alternative approaches to reporting UK greenhouse gas emissions
report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-greenhouse-gas-
emissions-explanatory-notes) outlines the differences between them.

For the purposes of reporting, greenhouse gas emissions are allocated into a
small number of broad, high level sectors known as National Communication
sectors, which are as follows: energy supply, business, transport, public,
residential, agriculture, industrial processes, land use land use change and
forestry (LULUCF), and waste management.

These high-level sectors are made up of a number of more detailed sectors,
which follow the definitions set out by the [International Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC)](http://www.ipcc.ch/), and which are used in international
reporting tables which are submitted to the [United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)](https://unfccc.int/) every year. A
[list of corresponding Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) used and a record of
base year emissions](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-greenhouse-
gas-emissions-explanatory-notes) are published separately.

This is a National Statistics publication and complies with the Code of
Practice for Statistics.

Duty](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/beer-duty) and [Cider
Duty](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/cider-duty).

The Alcohol Bulletin is updated quarterly and includes statistics on duty
receipts up to the latest full month before its release, and statistics
relating to clearances and production that are one month behind that of duty
receipts.

  dcterms:description """This publication provides the final estimates of UK territorial greenhouse gas
emissions going back to 1990. Estimates are presented by source in February of
each year. They are updated in March of each year to include estimates by end-
user, and in June to include estimates by Standard Industrial Classification
(SIC).

These statistics covers emissions that occur within the UK’s borders. When
emissions are reported by source, emissions are attributed to the sector that
emits them directly. When emissions are reported by end-user, energy supply
emissions by source are reallocated in accordance with where the end-use
activity occurred. This reallocation of emissions is based on a modelling
process. For example, all the carbon dioxide produced by a power station is
allocated to the power station when reporting on a source basis. However, when
applying the end-user method, these emissions are reallocated to the users of
this electricity, such as domestic homes or large industrial users.

BEIS does not estimate emissions outside the UK associated with UK
consumption, however the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
publishes estimates of the [UK’s carbon
footprint](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/uks-carbon-footprint)
annually.

For the purposes of reporting, greenhouse gas emissions are allocated into a
small number of broad, high level sectors known as National Communication
sectors, which are as follows: energy supply, business, transport, public,
residential, agriculture, industrial processes, land use land use change and
forestry (LULUCF), and waste management.

These high-level sectors are made up of a number of more detailed sectors,
which follow the definitions set out by the [International Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC)](http://www.ipcc.ch/), and which are used in international
reporting tables which are submitted to the [United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)](https://unfccc.int/) every year.

This is a National Statistics publication and complies with the Code of
Practice for Statistics.

  dcterms:description """This publication provides the final estimates of UK territorial greenhouse gas
emissions going back to 1990. Estimates are presented by source in February of
each year. They are updated in March of each year to include estimates by end-
user, and in June to include estimates by Standard Industrial Classification
(SIC).

These statistics covers emissions that occur within the UK’s borders. When
emissions are reported by source, emissions are attributed to the sector that
emits them directly. When emissions are reported by end-user, energy supply
emissions by source are reallocated in accordance with where the end-use
activity occurred. This reallocation of emissions is based on a modelling
process. For example, all the carbon dioxide produced by a power station is
allocated to the power station when reporting on a source basis. However, when
applying the end-user method, these emissions are reallocated to the users of
this electricity, such as domestic homes or large industrial users.

BEIS does not estimate emissions outside the UK associated with UK
consumption, however the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
publishes estimates of the [UK’s carbon
footprint](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/uks-carbon-footprint)
annually.

For the purposes of reporting, greenhouse gas emissions are allocated into a
small number of broad, high level sectors known as National Communication
sectors, which are as follows: energy supply, business, transport, public,
residential, agriculture, industrial processes, land use land use change and
forestry (LULUCF), and waste management.

These high-level sectors are made up of a number of more detailed sectors,
which follow the definitions set out by the [International Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC)](http://www.ipcc.ch/), and which are used in international
reporting tables which are submitted to the [United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)](https://unfccc.int/) every year.

This is a National Statistics publication and complies with the Code of
Practice for Statistics.

Data source

This is additional analysis using the HMRC Regional Trade in Goods Statistics.

How to interpret the data

Business Count: This data shows the number of businesses importing or exporting goods. This is broken down by their UK region and partner countries.
Regional comparisons: This data shows import or export data within a particular quarter or year for UK regions alongside the same data for the UK. This is based on three metrics; the number of importing or exporting businesses , the value of trade, and the average value per business.

Businesses can appear in more than one quarter and can trade with more than one destination. Therefore users should not add up across quarters or partner countries.

1. Methodology for allocating businesses to UK regions

As a result of the HMRC RTS methodology consultation the way businesses are allocated to UK region and country has changed. The previous methodology allocated trade to a region based on where the headquarters of a business is located, supplemented by survey data to allow better allocation of multi-site businesses.
This survey data is out of date and HMRC decided to develop a new methodology.
In the current methodology the trade value of a multi-site business is allocated to different regions based on a proportion of their employees in each region (based on linked information from the Inter Departmental Business Register).
Data on the number of traders is shown in two different way in the RTS release tables:
Whole Number Method (does not add up to UK total): A business will be counted as one in every region they have employees. This represents the actual count of businesses in any region. However, it will mean the sum of the business count for each region will be greater than that for the UK.

Proportion Method (adds up to UK total): A business will be counted as a fraction in each region they trade based on the proportion of their employees in each region. An individual business counts as one business in the UK. The sum of businesses (whole and fractions) gives the total business count for a region.
The data in this analysis uses both methods. Please refer to the correct output for each methodology and flow.

2. The number of businesses importing or exporting

Business counts are a count of all VAT Registered businesses exporting and importing.
Aside from the EU/non-EU split (published as part of the RTS) there is no disaggregation of businesses not required to submit full EU declarations (below threshold traders) by EU partner country. The supplementary analysis provided here does split the number of businesses by EU partner country but these do not include the below threshold traders.

Exclusions
This dataset excludes businesses that cannot be allocated to a region due to lack of information about the business (unallocated - unknown). It does include businesses where details are known, but cannot be allocated due to the type of business (unallocated - known).  Further information can be found in the

RTS Methodology paper.

This analysis also excludes 'unallocated - unknown' in the UK value totals, in order to make ratios (exports per exporter) and comparisons valid. Where information is known about a business but it is not possible to allocate to a specific region it is classed as 'unallocated - known'. These 'unallocated - known' businesses are included in both the value and count for UK totals.
RTS data excludes trade in non-monetary gold, whereas HMRC OTS data does include this from 2005 onwards. RTS data also excludes non-response estimates. Therefore, it matches the 'total reported trade' figures in the OTS with the exception of non-monetary gold. More information can be found in section 3.20 of the RTS Methodology Paper.

Suppressions
A very small number of cells in the Business Counts tab have been suppressed under our statistical disclosure policy. These are shown a ‘S’ under the business count. Due to a review of disclosure, some data previously suppressed under the output produce by Department for International Trade (Exports proportion method only) may now be shown.
Further information on trade in goods by UK region
HMRC publish quarterly data on trade by UK region in Regional Trade in Goods Statistics. This includes information on the number of exporters to the EU and Non-EU.

2020 data is provisional and subject to update.

The carbon footprint refers to emissions that are associated with the

which are directly generated by households through private
motoring and burning fuel to heat homes. These emissions are often referred

  pmdcat:markdownDescription """
Monthly import country-by-commodity data on the UK's trade in goods, including trade by all countries and selected commodities, non-seasonally adjusted.

Users should note the following:
Industry data has been produced using Standard Industrial Classification 2007 (SIC07).
Commodity data has been produced using Standard International Trade Classification (SITC).

Due to risks around disclosing data related to individual firms we are only able to provide data for certain combinations of the dimensions included, i.e. country, commodity and industry. This dataset therefore provides the following two combinations:
    Industry (SIC07 2 digit), by Commodity (SITC 2 digit), by geographic region (worldwide, EU and non-EU)
    Industry (SIC07 2 digit), by Commodity total, by individual country

Methodology improvements
Within this latest experimental release improvements have been made to the methodology that has resulted in some revisions when compared to our previous release in April 2019.
These changes include; improvements to the data linking methodology and a targeted allocation of some of the Balance of Payments (BoP) adjustments to industry.
The data linking improvements were required due to subtleties in both the HMRC data and IDBR not previously recognised within Trade.

While we are happy with the quality of the data in this experimental release we have noticed some data movements, specifically in 2018.
We will continue to review the movements seen in both the HMRC microdata and the linking methodology and, where appropriate, will further develop the methodology for Trade in Goods by Industry for future releases.

  pmdcat:markdownDescription """New questions were introduced into the survey from the year ending March 2013, and estimates from this year onwards are calculated using these new questions. Estimates for earlier years are calculated from the original questions with an adjustment applied to make them comparable to the new questions. From April 2017, the upper age limit for the self-completion module was increased to ask all respondents aged 16 to 74. Figures for 16 to 59 year olds only are presented in this table to allow comparisons to be made over a longer time period. A small change to the weighting procedure was made in 2019. This change is being applied going forward and was incorporated into all historic datasets. The effect of this change will only have a negligible impact on the estimates in this table and therefore historic data have not been re-calculated using the new weights, except for the year ending March 2018, where direct comparisons were previously made to the year ending March 2019. Estimates for the year ending March 2005 could not be re-calculated due to a manual adjustment which was applied to make the data comparable with the year ending 2013 onwards. More information can be found in footnote 3.	No data is available for the year ending March 2008 because comparable questions on any domestic abuse, any partner abuse and any family abuse were not included in that year. The sample size is lower for the years ending March 2011, March 2012 and March 2013 than for other years due to use of a split-sample experiment in these years. The sample size is lower for the years ending March 2018 and March 2019 due to use of a split-sample experiment. The sum of the overarching domestic abuse categories is not the sum of the sub-categories as some victims may be included in multiple categories as they can experience more than one type of abuse. The bases given are for any domestic abuse except for year ending March 2008 which is for partner abuse (non-sexual); the bases for the other measures presented will be similar."""^^<https://www.w3.org/ns/iana/media-types/text/markdown#Resource>;

Once sequestered the carbon is stored in the forest within living biomass, soil and litter and contributes to the forest carbon stock. The forest carbon sink describes the natural reservoir that accumulates and stores sequestered carbon. The forest carbon sink is dynamic and can gain (e.g., sequestration by photosynthesis) and lose (e.g., emission by forest fires) carbon. The forest carbon sink is quantified as the net annual accumulation of carbon (carbon sequestration) by living biomass, soils and litter in forests."^^<https://www.w3.org/ns/iana/media-types/text/markdown#Resource>;

From 2020 onwards figures relate to the median time taken by the appropriate response vehicle to respond to an incident. Calculations are based on the time taken to respond to each incident within a one month time period (August). This data refers to CAT1, CAT1(T) and CAT2 emergency responses, excluding Healthcare Professionals (HCP) calls.
Prior to 2020, figures relate to the median i.e. midpoint value is reported rather than the simple average as it is unaffected by atypically long or short response times.
The median response time for response to incidents is calculated over the month of August as a sample of the calendar year. Measured in minutes and seconds. Data supplied by the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service (NIAS). Data refers to Categories A, B & C emergency responses, excluding Healthcare Professional (HCP) calls. The median (i.e. the midpoint) is reported rather than the simple average as it is unaffected by atypically long or short response times (outliers).
Further analysis of this data for most and least deprived areas and also rural comparisons are available from the Department of Health, health inequalities statistics. Sub-regional inequality analysis are also available which includes analysis of inequality gaps within HSC Trust and LGD areas.

  pmdcat:markdownDescription """
    The carbon footprint refers to emissions that are associated with the consumption
    spending of UK residents on goods and services, wherever in the world these
    emissions arise along the supply chain, and those which are directly generated by
    UK households through private motoring and burning fuel to heat homes.
    These emissions are often referred to as 'consumption emissions' to distinguish them from
    estimates relating to the emissions 'produced' within a country's territory or economic
    sphere. To find out what effect UK consumption has on GHG emissions we
    need to take into account where the goods we buy come from and their associated
    supply chains.


Since 1997, the UK economy has continued to move from a manufacturing base towards
    the services sector. One of the consequences of this is that more of the goods we buy
    and use are now produced overseas. This statistical release breaks down emissions
    into: those produced and consumed in the UK; those generated by households
    directly through heating and motoring; and those emissions relating to imports either
    from China, USA, Europe or the Rest of the World. It excludes emissions arising from
    UK produced goods that are exported.

Woodland is defined in UK forestry statistics as land under stands of trees with a
minimum area of 0.5 hectares and a canopy cover of at least 20%, or having the
potential to achieve this. The definition relates to land use, rather than land cover,
so integral open space and felled areas that are awaiting restocking are included as
woodland. Further information, including how this UK definition compares with the
international definition of woodland, is provided in the Sources chapter.
Statistics on woodland area are used to inform government policy and resource
allocation, to provide context to UK forestry and land management issues and are
reported to international organisations. They are also used in the compilation of
natural capital accounts.
Increases in woodland area result from the creation of new woodland. This can be
achieved through new planting or by natural colonisation of trees. Further
information is available https://cdn.forestresearch.gov.uk/2022/09/Ch1_Woodland_2022.pdf

These statistics provide a breakdown of greenhouse gas emissions
across the UK, using nationally available datasets going back to 2005. This year we have
included estimates of methane and nitrous oxide emissions in these statistics
for the first time, in addition to the carbon dioxide emissions estimates
which were published previously. Estimates of emissions within National Park areas
have also been included in the statistics for the first time.

The main data sources are the UK National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory
and the BEIS National Statistics of energy consumption for local authority
areas. All emissions included in the national inventory are covered except
those from aviation, shipping and military transport, for which there is no
obvious basis for allocation to local areas, and emissions of fluorinated gases,
for which suitable data are not available to estimate these emissions at a local
level.

Energy Intensity is the amount of energy per unit of output.  Units of output vary depending on the sector and sub-sector and relate to such economic activity as number of passengers and distance travelled for the transport sector, whilst changes in the ONS' Index of Production data are used to estimate trends in output for the industrial sector.

The datacube is split into sectors: transport (road), domestic (household), industrial, and services, with the datacube showing energy consumption for that sector/sub sector, output factor, and consumption per unit of output.

  pmdcat:markdownDescription """### Update 7 February 2023: We need your feedback

To ensure UK territorial greenhouse gas emissions statistics best meet users’
needs we are seeking your feedback on replacing the ‘National Communication’
sector categorisation of UK emissions sources and sinks from February 2024.
For further information see the document here requesting feedback. Please send
feedback to
[Greenhousegas.statistics@beis.gov.uk](mailto:Greenhousegas.statistics@beis.gov.uk)
by 30 April 2023.

This publication provides the final estimates of UK territorial greenhouse gas
emissions going back to 1990. Figures for all years since 1990 have been
revised since the last publication to incorporate methodological improvements
and new data, so the estimates presented here supersede previous ones.

Estimates are presented by source in February of each year. They are updated
in March of each year to include estimates with energy supply emissions on an
end-user basis, and in June to include estimates by Standard Industrial
Classification (SIC).

The statistics cover emissions that occur within the UK’s borders. When
emissions are reported by source, emissions are attributed to the sector that
emits them directly. When emissions are reported by end-user, energy supply
emissions by source are reallocated in accordance with where the end-use
activity occurred. This reallocation of emissions is based on a modelling
process. For example, all the carbon dioxide produced by a power station is
allocated to the power station when reporting on a source basis. However, when
applying the end-user method, these emissions are reallocated to the users of
this electricity, such as domestic homes or large industrial users.

BEIS does not estimate emissions outside the UK associated with UK
consumption, however the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
publishes estimates of [the UK’s carbon
footprint](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/uks-carbon-footprint)
annually.

For the purposes of reporting, greenhouse gas emissions are allocated into a
small number of broad, high-level sectors known as National Communication
sectors, which are as follows: energy supply, business, transport, public,
residential, agriculture, industrial processes, land use land use change and
forestry (LULUCF), and waste management.

These high-level sectors are made up of a number of more detailed sectors,
which follow the definitions set out by the [International Panel on Climate
Change](http://www.ipcc.ch/) (IPCC), and which are used in international
reporting tables which are submitted to the [United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)](https://unfccc.int/) every year.

This is a National Statistics publication and complies with the Code of
Practice for Statistics.

  pmdcat:markdownDescription """Data on sales and jobs in small businesses are taken from Xero, a global cloud-based accounting software platform with 785,000 small business subscribers in the UK.
Small businesses are here defined by Xero as organisations with fewer than 20 employees.
Sales are measured based on the face value of invoices issued by firms within each month (including via apps attached to the Xero account).
Jobs are measured based on the number of unique employees of a business who are issued a payslip in a month. One individual is one payslip in a particular month if they work at least 1 hour in that month. The sample of small businesses is restricted based on the employment size band and erroneous payslips or those identified for non-wage purposes are excluded. Growth in small business jobs is calculated using the weighted average of within-firm year-on-year growth in jobs. As such, this accounts for any change in subscriber base and firms which shutdown entirely due to the pandemic.
Sales are measured based on the face value of invoices issued by firms within each month. Subscriber base changes are accounted for by measuring sales growth in one specific month using the sample of firms which also operated in the previous year."""^^<https://www.w3.org/ns/iana/media-types/text/markdown#Resource>;

VAT reporters received in the first seven days after the reporting period are included. Given that there are normally five working days in the first seven days of the month, the data content is relatively consistent month to month. This cut-off date was chosen to increase timeliness, while also being the earliest date when the key economic sectors provided a sufficiently accurate indicator of economic performance.

Originally introduced for navigational safety, AIS data can also be used as a source of information for monitoring trends in shipping activity.
We collect and aggregate these messages to identify the number of ships that travel within a port bounding box and remain there for a series of transmissions, before travelling outside of the boundary again. The AIS messages also allow us to identify a subset of all ships as cargo and tanker ships.
This dataset provides the number of daily visits for 16 of the UK's most significant freight ports by tonnage, and a sum of those visits as a UK total. The UK total is seasonally adjusted using the seasonal adjustment method TRAMO-SEATS modified to deal with higher frequency time series."""^^<https://www.w3.org/ns/iana/media-types/text/markdown#Resource>;

  pmdcat:markdownDescription """These data are daily flight figures from the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation (EUROCONTROL). Daily flight numbers for the UK alongside other countries are available in EUROCONTROL's dashboard. EUROCONTROL is a pan-European, civil-military organisation dedicated to supporting European aviation. Its Aviation Intelligence and Performance Review Unit provides independent collection and validation of air navigation services' performance-related data and intelligence gathering.
The flights data include international arrivals and departures to and from the UK (including Crown dependencies) and domestic UK flights but exclude overflights (flights that pass over UK territory). They capture all flight movements that operate under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR), where the pilot uses instruments in the flight deck to control, guide and adjust the plane. This includes commercial flights carrying passengers and cargo as well as non-commercial flights such as private and military flights.
Data from EUROCONTROL do not include information on the volume of passengers or cargo carried on UK flights. Especially in the context of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, flights might not be operating at full capacity and therefore trends in passengers and cargo will differ from trends in flights presented here."""^^<https://www.w3.org/ns/iana/media-types/text/markdown#Resource>;

The data can be subject to extreme within-day trading prices, which can lead to skewing of actual traded prices. It must also be noted that while these data reflect spot prices on the day, traders can opt for futures contracts where the buyer and the seller agree the market-determined price for gas for a future date. Other markets also exist for wholesale gas trading in Great Britain.

This data relates to the Energy Performance of Buildings Certificates published alongside the Energy Performance of Buildings Certificates Statistical release 26 January 2023.
The data is drawn from certificates for existing domestic properties lodged on the Energy Performance of Buildings Registers since 2008, including average energy efficiency ratings and numbers of certificates recorded.

The Energy Performance Certificates (EPC) register does not hold data for every domestic and non-domestic building or every building occupied by public authorities in England and Wales.
Buildings only require an EPC when, sold, let or constructed.  These statistics should, therefore, not be interpreted as a true representation of the whole of the building stock in England and Wales, but viewed as part of a wider package of Government’s provision of information on the energy efficiency of buildings.

This data relates to the Energy Performance of Buildings Certificates published alongside the Energy Performance of Buildings Certificates Statistical release 26 January 2023.
The data is drawn from certificates for new domestic properties lodged on the Energy Performance of Buildings Registers since 2008, including average energy efficiency ratings and numbers of certificates recorded.

The Energy Performance Certificates (EPC) register does not hold data for every domestic and non-domestic building or every building occupied by public authorities in England and Wales.
Buildings only require an EPC when, sold, let or constructed.  These statistics should, therefore, not be interpreted as a true representation of the whole of the building stock in England and Wales, but viewed as part of a wider package of Government’s provision of information on the energy efficiency of buildings.

  pmdcat:markdownDescription """This publication provides the latest provisional estimates of UK territorial greenhouse gas emissions based on provisional inland energy consumption statistics, which are published in the quarterly [Energy Trends](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/energy-trends).

For the purposes of reporting, greenhouse gas emissions are allocated into a small number of broad, high level sectors as follows: energy supply, business, transport, public, residential, agriculture, industrial processes, land use land use change and forestry (LULUCF), and waste management. Additionally, provisional emissions for carbon dioxide (CO2) only are allocated into broad fuel classifications as follows: gas, oil, coal, other solid fuels and non-fuel.

These territorial provisional emissions estimates are subject to revision when the final estimates are published; however, they provide an early indication of emissions in the most recent full calendar year.

This is a National Statistics publication and complies with the Code of Practice for Statistics. Please check our [guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-greenhouse-gas-emissions-statistics-user-guidance) or email [GreenhouseGas.Statistics@beis.gov.uk](mailto:GreenhouseGas.Statistics@beis.gov.uk) if you have any questions or comments about the information on this page.

  - LULUCF: land use, land use change and forestry
  - CO2: carbon dioxide

### How to read time intervals in ISO8601 format
This dataset uses custom time intervals format for periods, YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00/PnI, where P tells that this is period; n is the number of intervals and I is interval type which can be Y(year), M(month), W(week), D(day).
For example, from April 2019 to March 2022 is represented as 2019-04-01T00:00:00/P3Y, which can be read as '3 years period starts from 1st of April 2019 and ends on 31st March 2022'.
For more instructions on how to read this, please visit [Time intervals on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_intervals)."""^^<https://www.w3.org/ns/iana/media-types/text/markdown#Resource>;

### Source Notes and Caveats
On 31 October 2022, alongside the publication of the latest personal well-being estimates for the period between April 2021 to March 2022, previously published estimates for the periods between April 2011 and March 2019 have been updated due to changes in guidance on data suppression, where estimates are no longer required to be suppressed solely based on their co-efficient of variation (CV) values. Previously published estimates were suppressed based on their co-efficient of variation (CV) values being over 20. Estimates have also been updated following quality assurance of previous publications.

### Source Notes and Caveats
This indicator is based on re-weighted Annual Population Survey datasets updated on 16 August 2022. For more information, see [Impact of reweighting on Labour Force Survey key indicators: 2022](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/impactofreweightingonlabourforcesurveykeyindicators/2022)



### How to read time intervals in ISO8601 format
This dataset uses custom time intervals format for periods, YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00/PnI, where P tells that this is period; n is the number of intervals and I is interval type which can be Y(year), M(month), W(week), D(day).
For example, from April 2019 to March 2022 is represented as 2019-04-01T00:00:00/P3Y, which can be read as '3 years period starts from 1st of April 2019 and ends on 31st March 2022'.

### Source Notes and Caveats
On 31 October 2022, alongside the publication of the latest personal well-being estimates for the period between April 2021 to March 2022, previously published estimates for the periods between April 2011 and March 2019 have been updated due to changes in guidance on data suppression, where estimates are no longer required to be suppressed solely based on their co-efficient of variation (CV) values. Previously published estimates were suppressed based on their co-efficient of variation (CV) values being over 20. Estimates have also been updated following quality assurance of previous publications.

### Source Notes and Caveats
Data presented have been extracted from the Home Office Homicide Index which contains detailed record-level information about each homicide recorded by police in England and Wales. The Homicide Index is continually updated with revised information from the police as investigations continue and as cases are heard by the courts. The data refer to the position as at 6 December 2022. The data will change as subsequent court hearings take place or as further information is received.



### How to read time intervals in ISO8601 format
This dataset uses custom time intervals format for periods, YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00/PnI, where P tells that this is period; n is the number of intervals and I is interval type which can be Y(year), M(month), W(week), D(day).
For example, from April 2019 to March 2022 is represented as 2019-04-01T00:00:00/P3Y, which can be read as '3 years period starts from 1st of April 2019 and ends on 31st March 2022'.
For more instructions on how to read this, please visit [Time intervals on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_intervals)."""^^<https://www.w3.org/ns/iana/media-types/text/markdown#Resource>;

### How to read time intervals in ISO8601 format
This dataset uses custom time intervals format for periods, YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00/PnI, where P tells that this is period; n is the number of intervals and I is interval type which can be Y(year), M(month), W(week), D(day).
For example, from April 2019 to March 2022 is represented as 2019-04-01T00:00:00/P3Y, which can be read as '3 years period starts from 1st of April 2019 and ends on 31st March 2022'.

### Source Notes and Caveats
On 31 October 2022, alongside the publication of the latest personal well-being estimates for the period between April 2021 to March 2022, previously published estimates for the periods between April 2011 and March 2019 have been updated due to changes in guidance on data suppression, where estimates are no longer required to be suppressed solely based on their co-efficient of variation (CV) values. Previously published estimates were suppressed based on their co-efficient of variation (CV) values being over 20. Estimates have also been updated following quality assurance of previous publications.

### How to read time intervals in ISO8601 format
This dataset uses custom time intervals format for periods, YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00/PnI, where P tells that this is period; n is the number of intervals and I is interval type which can be Y(year), M(month), W(week), D(day).
For example, from April 2019 to March 2022 is represented as 2019-04-01T00:00:00/P3Y, which can be read as '3 years period starts from 1st of April 2019 and ends on 31st March 2022'.

### Source

### Source Notes and Caveats
- All figures include LA maintained schools, academies and free schools. Excludes alternative provision and independent schools.
- Figures for 2022 are based on revised data.
- Figures for Isles of Scilly and City of London are based on a single school in each local authority and therefore figures have been suppressed.
- Users are advised to take care when interpreting writing and science teacher assessment measures and reading, writing and maths (combined) measures for West Sussex, particularly when making comparisons over time or between local authorities. This local authority has higher rates of missing teacher assessment in 2022 than other areas. See [Key stage 2 attainment Methodology](https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/methodology/key-stage-2-attainment).



### How to read time intervals in ISO8601 format
This dataset uses custom time intervals format for periods, YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00/PnI, where P tells that this is period; n is the number of intervals and I is interval type which can be Y(year), M(month), W(week), D(day).
For example, from April 2019 to March 2022 is represented as 2019-04-01T00:00:00/P3Y, which can be read as '3 years period starts from 1st of April 2019 and ends on 31st March 2022'.
For more instructions on how to read this, please visit [Time intervals on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_intervals)."""^^<https://www.w3.org/ns/iana/media-types/text/markdown#Resource>;

### Source Notes and Caveats
On 31 October 2022, alongside the publication of the latest personal well-being estimates for the period between April 2021 to March 2022, previously published estimates for the periods between April 2011 and March 2019 have been updated due to changes in guidance on data suppression, where estimates are no longer required to be suppressed solely based on their co-efficient of variation (CV) values. Previously published estimates were suppressed based on their co-efficient of variation (CV) values being over 20. Estimates have also been updated following quality assurance of previous publications.
