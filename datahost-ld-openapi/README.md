# Datahost LD API Service

# Rationale

The goals of Datahost are to support the following requirements:

- Provide a dataset catalogue
- Provide CSVW downloads of datasets
- Allow publishers to make and keep promises about datasets' structure
- When structure needs to change, make this clear to consumers
- Provide a version history of data over time, where data can be added, corrected or retracted, with details of what's changed
- Help support publishers in using this model correctly
- Reduce barriers to publication over the previous PMD4 approach: publishers don't need to generate and supply RDF
- Reduce barriers to consumption: a REST based API and CSV(W) downloads mean that users don't need to be RDF experts to programmatically access the data. CSV downloads will be quick to download at a single, easy to find URL.
- Establish a scalable architecture, where we optimise for the simple and most common cases (e.g. for consumers: finding and downloading a dataset, or for publishers: publishing datasets and making them available at a known time), while providing a foundation to add more complex features later.

## Background

Definitions of the terminology used to describe the resources available through this API are available in the [Data Model Definitions doc here](https://github.com/Swirrl/datahost-prototypes/blob/main/datahost-ld-openapi/doc/data-model-definitions.md).

The resources available are structured as a tree, with dataset series at the top. Each dataset series can have one or more releases, which each have exactly one schema. Each release can have one or more revisions, which each have a series of commits that describe the contents of the revision. A schematic of this resource tree can be seen [in this diagram](https://github.com/Swirrl/datahost-prototypes/blob/main/doc/data-model.md).



# Usage

The API is deployed and available for use at https://ldapi-prototype.gss-data.org.uk/index.html. Documentation is available inline in the swagger spec there or in the [doc folder for this project](https://github.com/Swirrl/datahost-prototypes/tree/main/datahost-ld-openapi/doc).

# Builds

[Our CircleCI instance](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/Swirrl/datahost-prototypes) runs the tests and deploys docker containers to our public [GCP hosted container registry](https://console.cloud.google.com/artifacts/docker/swirrl-devops-infrastructure-1/europe-west2/public/datahost-ld-openapi):

If the tests pass images are built and tagged with the following tags:

- The name of the branch (branch name tags will be mutated to track passing CI builds from the branch)
- The full commit sha of the passing build
- The names of any commit tags (or a unique abbreviated commit sha if there isn't one)

This means that the latest `main` version can be found at:

`europe-west2-docker.pkg.dev/swirrl-devops-infrastructure-1/public/datahost-ld-openapi:main`

# Dev

Start a REPL and from the user namespace first run:

```clojure
(dev)
```

Then use `(start)` and `(reset)` to start and restart the service from the REPL.

`reset` will also reload changed namespaces.

To run tests, from this directory run:

```
$ clojure -X:dev:test
```

## Basic Auth

To turn on basic authentication in any environment, include the `:auth/basic`
profile, E.G.,

``` shell
$ clojure -X:auth/basic:dev
```
